	"Oh god, aliens? Your explanation for anything slightly peculiar is aliens, isn't it? You lose your keys, it's aliens. A picture falls off the wall, it's aliens. That time we used up a whole bog roll in a day, you thought that was aliens as well."

	"You make love like a Japanese meal - small portions, but so many courses."
	"Sir, I beg you to reconsider. If not for your sanity, you haven't even considered the moral implications of your decision. You will be joining a society where you will be compelled to have sex with beautiful, brilliant women twice daily, on demand. Now, am I the only one here who finds that just a little bit tacky? *looks around* Well, quite clearly, I am."

	"I have a medium-sized fire axe buried in my spinal column. That sort of thing can really put a crimp on your day."
	"I'll tell you one thing, I've been to a parallel universe, I've seen time running backwards, I've played pool with planets and I've given birth to twins, but I never thought in my entire life I'd taste an edible Pot Noodle."
	"Yes there is. You're saying there's some huge damn fish out there aren't yer? Some kinda gigantic weird pre-historic leviathan who's porked his way through this entire ocean."
	"Why would a haddock kill itself? ......... why am I even asking that question?"
	"There's only three alternatives, it thinks we're either a threat, food or a mate.... It's either gonna kill us, eat us or hump us. Either we persuade him we're not that kinda oceanic salvage vessel or we scarper pronto."

	"Space Corps Directive 34124? No Officer with false teeth should attempt oral sex in zero gravity."
	"I'm not afraid, Mr. Death, sir. I believe my friends have bought me enough time to complete the Dove program. Now, if you'll forgive the rather confrontational imperative... Go for yer guns, ya scum-sucking molluscs!!"
	"Kerplunk kerplunk - whoops, where's my thribble?"
	"Next time I see him he'll be suffering from a fist-related teeth disorder."
	"%%, kindly get to the point before I jam your nose between your cheeks and make it the filling of a buttock sandwich."
	"There's one thing you should know. Last time we met I was wearing a cute little black number with peach trim and gold spangles, and although it looks like I'm wearing the same outfit today, it is in fact an entirely different cute little black number, with completely different gold spangles!"
	"That was an important statement, sir, and it needed to be made. However, might I suggest that the rest of this discourse be conducted by those with brains larger than a grape?"
	"Hermann Goering was 'a bit dodgy'?!?!"
	"Garbled, confusing, and quite frankly duller than an in-flight magazine produced by Air Belgium."
	"I never want to see or hear from the scum-sucking, lying, weasel-minded smeg-head in my entire life!"
	"Sigmund Freud eat your heart out."
	"Let's at least ask someone who's at least going to give us a slightly more intelligent opinion. Hello, wall! What do you think?"
	"This is the first time I've ever been seduced by predeterminism theory."
